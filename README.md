## About
Food Venture is a game where you manage a restaurant, prepare and deliver food orders to customers using workstations, earn money, and use it to upgrade your workstations, unlock new features, and expand your restaurant.

## Gameplay
### Taking Orders:
- Customers will enter your restaurant and place an order. Cashiers will automatically take their orders in order.

### Preparing Orders:
- After taking an order, a workstation will be assigned automatically to a chef/cashier. The chef/cashier will then start cooking the order.

### Delivering Orders:
- Once the chef/cashier has finished preparing an order, they will deliver it automatically to the customer. The customer will pay the fee and leave. 

### Upgrading Workstations:
- Use the money earned from delivering orders to upgrade your workstations. Upgrades will increase the efficiency of your workstations, allowing you to earn more money from delivering orders.

## Controls
- Mouse: Use the mouse to upgrade workstations and control the camera.
